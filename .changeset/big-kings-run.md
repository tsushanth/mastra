'mastracode': patch
---

Improved MastraCode web syntax highlighting, switched the web UI to the shared Playground UI stylesheet, restored React Query-backed sidebar auth actions, reorganized the web UI internals into reusable UI and domain folders, added a React Query-backed Workspaces sidebar section for GitHub project worktrees, moved project/repository data loading onto React Query-backed domain hooks, and consolidated global keydown listeners behind a shared `useKeyDown` hook.
