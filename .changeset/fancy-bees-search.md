Added file-system-routed workflows support. Workflows placed in `workflows/*.ts` under the mastra directory are now auto-discovered and registered during `mastra dev` / `mastra build`, matching the existing file-based agents convention. Code-registered workflows win on name collisions.

```ts
// src/mastra/workflows/onboarding.ts
import { createWorkflow } from '@mastra/core/workflows';

export default createWorkflow({ id: 'onboarding' /* ...steps */ });
```
